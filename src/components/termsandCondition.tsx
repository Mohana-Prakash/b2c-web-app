          <b>Privacy Policy</b>
        </h6>
        <p>
          To open your account you will be required to provide certain personal and company details.
          However, any personal information about yourself or others, will be treated securely,
          fairly and lawfully. We are committed to protecting your privacy. Personal data, or
          personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can
          be identified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your personal data includes information submitted by filling in forms during account
          creation or by corresponding with us by post, phone or email. When you provide personal
          information to us, we will only use it when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will
          use your personal data to communicate with you and to provide you with information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data
          other than in relation to sending direct marketing communications to you via email or text
          message. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.
          We will get your express opt-in consent before we use, or share your personal data with
          any third party, for marketing purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it,
          unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is
          compatible with the original purpose. We may use personal information you provide for the
          purpose of providing more relevant content to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we transfer your personal data out of Sri Lanka, we will ensure a similar degree of
          protection is afforded to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we
          collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or
          reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data,
          we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk
          of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data and the purposes for
          which we process your personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have any questions about this privacy notice, including any requests to exercise
          your legal rights, please contact us by email.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Data Protection Authority (DPA)
          of Sri Lanka for data protection issues (https://www.gov.lk/sri-lanka1/legal?). We would,
          however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the DPA so
          please contact us in the first instance.
